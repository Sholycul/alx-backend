# 0x00. Pagination

Welcome to the "0x00. Pagination" project! This directory contains code and resources related to implementing pagination in web applications. Pagination is an essential technique that allows for the efficient display of large datasets by dividing them into manageable chunks, typically presented over multiple pages.

## Contents

- **`0-paginate.py`**: Script that implements basic pagination functionality.
- **`1-simple_paginator.py`**: A simple paginator for a list of items, demonstrating how to paginate data.
- **`2-hypermedia_pagination.py`**: Implementation of pagination with hypermedia support, allowing for the inclusion of links to next and previous pages.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the directory and its contents.
- **`tests/`**: A directory containing test cases to ensure the functionality of the pagination implementations.
  - **`test_pagination.py`**: Unit tests for pagination functions.

## Installation and Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. This project does not have any external dependencies other than the Python standard library.

To run the code, you can use the command line:

```bash
python3 0-paginate.py
```

## Usage

Add your dataset (a list of dictionaries representing items) to the provided scripts, or modify the sample data as necessary to visualize how pagination works.

## Testing

Tests are located in the `tests/` directory. You can run the tests using Python's built-in unittest framework:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```
